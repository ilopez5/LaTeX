# Notes LaTeX Template

## Basic Usage
1. Modify beginning section/subsection with your information
2. Add sections and so forth as you go

## Options
You can modify the number of columns in the `\begin{multicols*}` line
by changing the parameter.

In addition, though I primarily used this for taking notes, it lends
itself to 'cheat sheets' for Open-Book exams!
